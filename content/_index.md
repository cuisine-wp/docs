# Cuisine

Cuisine is a collection of plugins that, all used together make WordPress development a lot more easy and fun. The three core plugins are:

* [Cuisine Core](/core) - the basic framework and utility belt.
* [Cuisine Sections](/sections) - a clean and developer-friendly layout builder.
* [Cuisine Forms](/forms) - a developer-oriented form builder.

Documentation for these three plugins, and extendsions on those plugins can be found on this page.

## Requirements

**PHP >= 5.4. Check with `php -v`.**

### Carte Blanche - Starter Theme
If you want to create a theme with Cuisine, we recommend starting out with our starter theme called [Carte Blanche](https://bitbucket.org/chefduweb/carte-blanche).

 

It's a completely empty theme, but with the right files scaffolded, a nice and clean folder structure, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) all setup with [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) and [Bourbon + Neat.](http://bourbon.io) to handle your grid system. It works great out-of-the-box with Cuisine.

### Crouton - Starter Plugin
If you're in this for plugin development we recommend you use our starter plugin. It doesn't do anything, but the files and folders are neatly structured and it contains examples for creating post-types, taxonomies, adding scripts and sass-files to the asset-pipeline and more good stuff.
