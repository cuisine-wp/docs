Cuisine uses WP CLI to clear certain options and cache. There are a few commands you can run to make your life a little easier.

Obviously, [you need WP CLI installed to be able to run these commands](http://wp-cli.org/).

##Clearing the Sass-pipeline
If you are creating new plugins, it sucks to manually overwrite the Sass file for that plugin every time. That's why we've created a command that force-reloads all Sass files for you:

> ## **wp cuisine sass**

This removes all plugin related Sass-files and re-copies them from the plugin directories into your theme.

##Clearing generated forms
If you work with our Form Plugin and you've created forms from code, you'll notice that you have to manually delete an option for the plugin to re-create the form again. This command automates that process for you:


> ## **wp cuisine forms**

It removes all forms generated from code and forces a refresh.
