Clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/chefduweb/cuisine.git` or install with composer:

`composer require chefduweb/cuisine`

After you have all the files you need to install cuisine like a regular WordPress plugin:

1. move the files to wp-content/plugins
2. get into the WordPress admin and go to plugins
3. activate Cuisine.
